# Dark Error Holes

This is a chrome extension was born out of frustration that 
chrome extensions (good one's) do not have permission to darkify 
chrome's error pages. 

NOTE: This does not darkify all webpages of browser.

This extension will replace error pages (no internet, DN not found, 
etc.) of chrome with dark themed pages. Also gives functionality to 
refresh the page with a single click.
