# Dark Error Holes

This is a chrome extension was born out of frustration that 
chrome extentions (good one's) do not have permission to darkify 
chrome's error pages. 

This extension will replace error pages (404, network not connected, 
etc.) of chrome with dark themed pages. Also gives functionality to 
refresh the page with a single click.
